This is a simple example plugin intended to demonstrate basic plugin structure
and best practices. It includes
* the plugin code for flags, commands, and implementation functions
* generated vim helpfiles
* tests / executable documentation

Suggested reading order is

1. `instant/flags.vim`
2. `plugin/commands.vim`
3. `autoload/helloworld.vim`

This is not intended to cover every nuance of developing maktaba plugins, but it
does touch on the major points and include very thorough explanations of what's
being done and why. For a more complete picture of how maktaba works, it's
recommended to consult the maktaba `vroom/` directory and the maktaba help
files.
